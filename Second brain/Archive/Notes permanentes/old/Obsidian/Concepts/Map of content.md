# Map of content
##Â Definition
A **map of content** (**MOC**) is a curated list of links, somewhat akin to a table of **contents**, that pulls together notes related to a topic. MOCs are an alternative way to organize information that provides the flexibility of tags along with a less-rigid hierarchy of folders.
