### Why No One Has Measured The Speed Of Light

This inspiring video reminds me of Feynman's book 'Light and Matter'. If I have understood this enlightening book, it seems QED describes light as a path integral, ie a superposition of innumerable paths and speeds of light. According to the action principle, and under the hypothesis that speed of light is the same in all directions, interference between all paths (virtual photons) results into the illusion that the photon speed is only c. Without that hypothesis, I guess QED (like Relativity does) will predict the same physics for all combinations of speeds of light , back-and-forth. Or can it be a QED lab experiment to settle whether or not speed of light is c in all directions ?
